Description: The Mapper algorithm from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), based on Nerve Theorem and Simplicial complex, the steps are as follows
    1. Define a filter (lens) function on the data. 
    2. Perform clustering within each level set. 
    3. Generate a simplicial complex from the clustering results.
